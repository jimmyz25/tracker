# AppleBerry

AppleBerry is developed to better track reliability activies in the lab. timestamps of each unit at each checkpoint (start and end) are collected. this complete timeseries enables automatic tagging of Rel events in data that is timestamped. This App also provides tableau output so user have more freedom to interact with data.

Design goal is to make input effortless with minimum chance to make mistakes, as everything depends on the timestamps collected.
